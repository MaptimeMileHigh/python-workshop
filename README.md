# Maptime Milehigh Python Workshop
Getting started with Python! (well sort of...)

The idea behind this workshop is not to teach the attendee the very basics of the language but instead to get his/her excited enough to learn more on their own.

This Jupyter notebook covers a series of steps to grab data from an API, plot some of it contents and create an interactive map. 

The user will need to have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) installed (version 2.7) .
